In conclusion, it is evident that hotspots and local densification of ethnic groups do exist. <br>However, patterns are beginning to change as a result of the growth of particular ethnic<br> groups in new areas. This is increasingly occuring due to older immigrants moving out<br> of hotspots (e.g. Indian and Lebanese) or new immigrants moving into new growth suburbs <br>(e.g. Chinese immigrants moving into city suburbs). Some ancestries (predominantly English <br>speaking) do not have any high density clusters and instead tend to be scattered around <br>Sydney due to their ability to adapt to any given environment. <br><br>

<u>Is it good to change the patterns observed?</u> <br><br>

This is a debatable question as there are both sides to the arguement. However, it is best to<br> keep local hotspots of different ethnic groups as it currently is. The reason for this is that<br> humans have an instinctive desire to be with like-minded people and those who share the <br>same beliefs and morals. For this reason, staying with those with the same background can <br>create a greater sense of belonging especially within a foreign country. This is predominately <br>the case for new and first generation immigrants. However, on the other side, by encouraging <br>new immigrants to be in a diverse community it creates an opportunity for them to interact <br>with different people which will allow them to adapt eaiser than those who move later on. <br><br>

Recent attempts in the form of new residential developments to reduce clustering of ethnic <br>groups have proven to be successful. Areas such as The Ponds, Kellyville and Schofields <br>are now home to a diverse range of people. Perhaps this is the best solution to keep a "balance" <br>in the spread of different ethnic groups.
