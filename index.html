<p style= "font-size: 25px;">Introduction</p>

<p> The objective of this data set on ancestry, using Parent's place of birth,<br> is to gain a better understanding of a person's ethnic background.<br> The purpose of asking for Parent's birth place is because a greater <br>percentage of people are becoming unsure about their true origins <br>and ancestry. <br><br>

The analysis on this data set will provide an understanding of how <br>different ethnic groups like to live, who they are surrounded by, <br>and how situations change with time. <br><br>

Chapter 1 provides a detailed understanding of where different ethnic <br>populations tend to live around and in which areas they dominate in <br>terms of density. It shows the growth of ethnic groups in locations <br>around Sydney over a span of five years. <br><br>

Chapter 2 has data taken from "G10_Country of Birth of Person by <br>Year of Arrival in Australia". This provides an extra component to <br>the story by presenting information and patterns on how ethnic <br>groups tend to move around Sydney based on how long they have <br>lived in the Country.  <br><br>

Chapter 3 presents information on how the data set is being used today <br>by both businesses and all stages of governments. <br><br>

With this data set comparisons can be made to languages, religions, and age.<br> However, this would not contribute to the story that is been told on this website.
