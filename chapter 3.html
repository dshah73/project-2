This particular data set is used by both businesses and the Government. <br>
<br>


<u><b>Businesses:</u></b> <br>
<br>


Many businesses will set their businesses in areas that have a high density of a <br>
particular ethnic population, offering products and services specific to the<br>
 dominant ethnicity of that area.  <br>
<br>



<i>Example 1:</i><br>
<br>
 In the Western Sydney region 
(Parramatta/Harris Park) there are numerous Indian <br>
restaurants, grocery and 
clothing shops within a small span to cater for the dense <br>
population of Indians 
living there. This is evident on a smaller scale in the Blacktown <br>
region, however, is growing. <br>
<br>


<i>Example 2:</i> <br>
<br>
In the Eastwood region, to cater for the dense Chinese population, there are numerous<br>
 Asian supermarkets. In addition, a wide range of advertisements on billboards around <br>
the suburb, particularly in train stations and bus stops, target the local Chinese <br>
population by having ads in Mandarin (or other local languages). Many cultural events <br>
also run in this region (ie, Chinese New Year). <br>
<br>
<br><br><br>

<u><b>Government:</u></b> <br>
<br>


The local/state Government will work with government bodies such as Urban Growth <br>
NSW to develop plans and implement housing projects in new areas <br>
(mainly Western Sydney) to create greater connectedness amongst different ethnic groups. <br> <br> 
For e.g. The Ponds/Schofields/Kellyville are suburbs which aim to cater for a diverse range<br>
 of ethnic populations. From Census data, these regions are home to a large population of <br>
Indians, Chinese, Italians, Philippines, and South Africans. Hence, there is a mixed <br>
population group instead of a  of 'hotspot' a particular ethnic group.
