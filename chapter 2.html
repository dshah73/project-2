This video shows the movement of different ethnic groups or ancestries<br> based on the year they arrived to Australia (from 1986-2016). <br> <br> 

In many cases, ethnic groups will either 'converge' to a particular area <br> (known as a 'hotspot') or 'diverge' away from a particular area. <br> However, this is evident  only a few or many years after immigrants have <br> arrived to Australia. <br> <br> 

<u><b>Indian Ancestry</u></b>: <br> <br> 

New Immigrants with an Indian ancestry will mainly settle around <br> the suburbs of Parramatta, Harris Park, Wenthworthville,  Toongabbie<br> and Westmead. Collectively, these suburbs form a local <br> hotspot within Western Sydney. <br> <br> 

After a few years, after the immigrants have become accustomed to<br>  their new environment, they will begin to 'diverge'  away from this<br> 'hotspot' and live in other areas around Sydney. <br> <br> 

This pattern is primarily due to: <br> <br> 

-<i><u>Changes in family structure</i></u>:<br><br> As family grows in size, larger homes as well as privacy is needed). <br> <br> 

-<i><u>New residential developments</i></u>:<br> <br>Families will be inclined to move to<br>  new locations such as developments in Western and South-West Sydney.<br> <br> 

-<i><u>Increase in wealth</i></u>: <br><br>After years of working and saving, many immigrants <br> will have enough money to move to wealthier suburbs (e.g. Castle Hill, <br> Baulkham Hills, East Surburbs and new residential developments). <br><br>


<u><b>Chinese Ancestry</u></b>: <br> <br> 


Recent Immigrants with a Chinese ancestry have initially settled around<br> different areas of Sydney rather than a particular hotspot. However, lately,<br> there has been an increase in the number of immigrants living around<br> Kensington and Camperdown due to the increase in international Chinese <br>students living around UNSW and USYD. <br><br>

It can be seen that Chinese immigrants living in Australia for more than <br>10 years are living in particular hotspots around Sydney, mainly <br>Eastwood/Epping, Burwood, and Hurtsville regions. <br><br>

This pattern is primarily due to: <br><br>

-<i><u>Increase in wealth</i></u>: <br><br>With greater buying power, older Chinese immigrants<br> are able to buy properties in competitive housing markets which form in <br>these hotspots. <br><br>

-<i><u>Reluctance to change</i></u>: <br><br>With the increase in local Chinese businesses <br>(e.g. grocery and speciality shops) in these hotspots, immigrants who <br>settled in these areas many years ago will be relcutant to relocate. <br>With their properties continually increasing in value, it provides them <br>with another reason to stay. <br><br>

-<i><u>Lack of space in hotspots</i></u>: <br><br>With competetive markets in hotspots, new <br>Chinese immigrants are forced to live in other areas in Sydney. <br>Slowly this is leading to the development of new hotspots around Sydney. 

<br> <br> 

<u><b>New Zealand Ancestry</u></b>: <br> <br> 

There is no pattern as such evident within New Zealand immigrants.<br>  Their residency is distributed evenly around Sydney and no hotspots <br> are evident. <br> <br> 

 They tend not necessarily seek to be close to others of the same ancestry. <br> This could be a result of their ability to interact and belong within any <br> given community. Infact, similarities can be drawn to those with an <br> Australian ancestry.
